What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?
<!--more-->

It is basically a text file in your source directory that tells "robots" (mostly search engines) which pages on your site to crawl/visit. It also tells robots which pages not to crawl/visit.
For my web page, I've configured my robot.txt to not allow any "robots" access. This doesn't stop bad robots from doing it anyway, as they can be configured to just ignore the text file.

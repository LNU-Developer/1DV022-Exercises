What do you think of pre-compiling your CSS?

Compare to regular CSS
Which techniques did you use?
Pros and cons?

Well, this one was quite interesting. 

When pre-compiling my CSS i used SASS, which was very similar to ordinary CSS. 
One major advantage that I see and used in my own web-page was the posibility to use variables. Just add a style into a variable and use it.
The second thing I used was nesting. The amount of code will be so much easier to read and use.

The disadvantage of pre-compiling that I noticed including a harder debugg if something doesn't work out right. The rows within your CSS file and HTML doesn't match your local files.
Compilation does slow down. The compilation in this case wasn't as fast as my live server, which meant it would take a few seconds instead of the instant effect I was used to.

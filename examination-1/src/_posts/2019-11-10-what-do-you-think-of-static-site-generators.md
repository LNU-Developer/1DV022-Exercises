What do you think of static site generators?

What type of projects are they suitable for?
<!--more-->

I think they are good if you want to create a standard site quickly. However it is not something I would use for a larger project.
I'm getting the feeling I lose control, and need to learn a new "langauge" per say, and that language isn't widespread, which means that my fellow developers working on the same team would have a harder time understanding.

What is humans.txt and how have you configure it for your site?

How did you implements comments to blog posts

What is Open Graph and how do you make use of it?
<!--more-->

The human.txt is similar to robot.txt, but it's purpose is to provide information about the people and techniques used on the site. I've just a simple template and written who the author is, the contacts as well as what was used on the site (like Jekyll).

I used Disqus on my site, which is free if you only want the basics. It was pretty easy, just registered took a standard code tailored to my account and added to my layouts.

When you past a link to chat sites/programs, like discord, slack or facebook and you see that little box under the link with quick information about the link? Well that is Open Graph. Basically creates a rich object to be used to share which elements of the page you want to present.

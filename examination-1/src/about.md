Hi everyone, isn't it fantastic to make some progress? I've always had the interest of becoming a full-stack developer. This is one side of the coin. Have a long way to go.

My name is Rickard Marjanovic, I'm 32 years "old" and living in Helsingborg. You can say I started off my adult life in a strange way.

Not knowing what I wanted I ended up with finishing a degree in economics, and continued my career as a public accountant. Even became an authorized public accountant a few years ago.

Even though I'm not expecting anyone here to know that that is or means, I can tell you it's hard work.
